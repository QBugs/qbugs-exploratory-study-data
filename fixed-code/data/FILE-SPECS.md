# Specifications of data files

## [fixed-code-data.csv](generated/fixed-code-data.csv)

File automatically generated by the script [compute-fixed-code-data.sh](../scripts/compute-fixed-code-data.sh).

- `project_full_name`: Full name of a GitHub project, i.e., organization + "/" + project-name
  * factor, e.g., "Qiskit/qiskit-ignis"

- `fix_commit_hash`: git commit hash of the fixed source code
  * factor, e.g., "ec1b4ce759f1fb8ba0242dd6c4a309fa1b586666"

- `buggy_commit_hash`: git commit hash of the buggy source code
  * factor, e.g., "60a75a25c0ba5c2d21c295d9d5892ecd722752f0" or "ec1b4ce759f1fb8ba0242dd6c4a309fa1b586666^1"

- `bug_id`: Bug id as original identified in the [Bugs in Quantum Computing Platforms: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14560)
  * factor: e.g., "1", "1909-5"

- `bug_type`: bug type
  * factor: "Classical" or "Quantum"

- `fixed_file_path`: relative path of the fixed file
  * factor, e.g., "qiskit_ignis/tomography/fitters/cvx_fit.py"

- `fixed_line_number`: line number of a fixed line
  * numerical, e.g., 7

- `fixed_component`: fixed comment in `fixed_line_number` as described in the [Python's AST](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) documentation
  * factor, e.g., "Call", "Assignment", etc

- `edit_action`: operation performed in the `buggy_component`
  * factor: "A" for addition, "I" for insert, "D" for delete, "M" for move, "U" for update, and "UNK" for unknown

Note that the same `fixed_line_number` in the same `fixed_file_path` of a `project_full_name`-`bug_id` bug could have more than one `fixed_component`.

- `fix_commit_hash`: git commit hash of the fixed source code
  * factor, e.g., "ec1b4ce759f1fb8ba0242dd6c4a309fa1b586666"

- `buggy_commit_hash`: git commit hash of the buggy source code
  * factor, e.g., "60a75a25c0ba5c2d21c295d9d5892ecd722752f0" or "ec1b4ce759f1fb8ba0242dd6c4a309fa1b586666^1"

- `bug_type`: bug type
  * factor: "Classical" or "Quantum"

- `file_path`: relative path of the added, updated, moved, renamed, deleted file
  * factor, e.g., "qiskit_ignis/tomography/fitters/cvx_fit.py"

## [type-of-file.csv](generated/type-of-file.csv)

- `bug_type`: bug type
  * factor:  "Classical" or "Quantum"

- `file_path`: path of the fixed file
  * factor: e.g., "qiskit-ignis/test/cvx_fit.py"

- `fix_commit_hash`: commit hash of the fix commit associated to the bug
